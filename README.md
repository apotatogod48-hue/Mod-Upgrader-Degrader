# Mod-Upgrader-Degrader
This is a piece of software that changes your mods in your .MineCraft folder to whatever version you have selected. It is pretty quick and you'll also get a back up of all the mods that you had before. (if the script cannot find the mod in the version or loader it will ask you to install it manually.)
