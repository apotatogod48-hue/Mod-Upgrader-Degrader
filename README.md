# Mod-Upgrader-Degrader
This is a piece of software that changes your mods in your .MineCraft folder to whatever version you have selected. It is pretty quick and you'll also get a back up of all the mods that you had before. (if the script cannot find the mod in the version or loader it will ask you to install it manually.)

# How To use
Step 1: Type in your version that you want to switch to into the text box. (make sure to type it in EXCATCLY or it will not work) Ex: 1.21.4

Step 2: Select your mod loader under the text box. (you can either pick from Fabric, Forge, Neoforge, and quilt)

Step 3: Find your Mod folder either let the script detect (or find it itself) or you can brwose for it manually. This is needed for it can actually put the new mods into your mod folder automatically

Step 4: Click the big green button that says Start Process and wait until the thing in the middle (I don't know what to call it) says processes complete
